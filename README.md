# Hangman_V_1_0
This is the starting of my python projects. I have learned python before but these projects helped me grow more and I am continuing the system. I did'nt know what github actually was except everyone was talking about it. Well as time progresses we also progresses if we put effort into it. This is another one of the CLI game i am developing.

## System Requirements
Works in almost all Python3.x

## Dependancies
Like Other ones I try to keep it without installing any additional package than the in-built

__I am soon going to make this version 2 of this game with more features and controls__
__Hope You like it :heart:__
